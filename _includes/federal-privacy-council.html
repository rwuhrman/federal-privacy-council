development opportunities of agency privacy professionals; improve the management of agency privacy programs by identifying 
and sharing lessons learned and best practices; and promote collaboration between and among agency privacy professionals to

<div  class="section_header">Vision</div><br>

<DIV style="font-size:18px;">Ensure that Privacy Practices and Privacy Programs Evolve
  to Help Promote and Maintain our Nation’s Core Values</DIV><BR>

<div style="font-size:16px;">The Federal Privacy Council will help to ensure that as Federal agencies carry out the diverse missions of the Federal 
Government, they do so in a manner that honors and respects the personal information entrusted to the Federal Government
by the American people and other individuals. Today, the United States is in the midst of a revolution of innovation and
opportunity based on the explosive growth of the digital economy and the wide-scale adoption of new technology.  To keep 
pace with this change, the Federal Privacy Council will identify more effective and innovative ways to help protect privacy 
across the Government while supporting efforts to deliver better and more efficient services for the American people.</DIV>
