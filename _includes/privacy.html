      How the Federal Privacy Council Uses Cookies

    <div id="b-a2" class="usa-accordion-content">
 
<P>When you visit a website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a 
“cookie” to place on your device. The cookie, which is unique to your browser, 
allows the server to “remember” specific information about your visit while you 
are connected.</P>
<P>There are two types of cookies — single session (temporary) and multi-session 
(persistent). Single session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is 
open. Once you close your browser, the session cookie disappears. Persistent 
cookies are stored on your device for longer periods. Both types of cookies 
create an identifier that is unique to your device.&nbsp; The <A href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-22.pdf">Office 
of Management and Budget Memorandum M-10-22, <EM>Guidance for Online Use of Web 
Measurement and Customization Technologies</EM></A>, allows Federal agencies to 
use both session and persistent cookies to improve the delivery of services.</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Session Cookies:</STRONG>&nbsp;We use session cookies for 
  technical purposes, such as to allow better navigation through our site. These 
  session cookies are set by GSA or a contractor acting on GSA’s behalf and let 
  the&nbsp;server hosting fpc.gov know that you are continuing a visit to our 
  site. Our use of session cookies qualifies as “Usage Tier 1—Single Session,” 
  as defined in the OMB M-10-22 guidance.</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>Persistent Cookies:</STRONG>&nbsp;We use persistent cookies to 
  understand the differences between new and returning visitors to 
  <EM>fpc.gov</EM>. &nbsp;Persistent cookies remain on your device between 
  visits to our site until they expire or are removed by the user. &nbsp;As 
  discussed below under “Google Analytics,” our&nbsp;use of persistent cookies 
  qualifies as “Usage Tier 2—Multi-session without personally identifiable 
  information,” as defined in the OMB M-10-22 guidance. The policy states, “This 
  tier encompasses any use of multi-session Web measurement and customization 
  technologies when no [personally identifiable information] is collected.” We 
  do not use persistent cookies to collect personally identifiable 
  information.</LI></UL>
<P>If you do not want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser’s options to 
stop accepting persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie

 <P><EM>Fpc.gov</EM> participates in the <A href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">U.S.

M-10-22</A> (PDF).</P>
<P>Here is how it works: Google Analytics sets one or more cookies on your

<EM>fpc.gov</EM> website in the future. This cookie(s) does not collect 
personally identifiable information. This is considered a Tier 2 usage, as 
defined in the OMB guidance.</P>

its cookie(s). The program <A href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/common-questions-about-dap-faq/#part-4">does 
not track individuals</A> and <A href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en">anonymizes 
the IP addresses</A> of visitors.&nbsp; <A href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/common-questions-about-dap-faq/">Common

Analytics handles IP addresses.&nbsp; According to GSA’s <A href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/common-questions-about-dap-faq/">Common 
Questions About DAP</A>, “none of the federal government data tracked as part of 
the Data Analytics Program will be shared with or available to Google’s 
corporate advertising partners.”</P>

browser, most modern browsers can be set up to accept, reject, or request user 
intervention when a site asks to set a cookie.</P>
