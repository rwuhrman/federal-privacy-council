Ms. Sylvia Burns joined the federal government as a Presidential Management 
Intern in 1994 after completing her Master's Degree in Business Management and 
Policy from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Her public service 
began at the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service at the International Trade 
Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, where she held several 
positions over 12 years. She served as the first Chief Architect at the 
International Trade Administration, where she led several high-priority 
technology projects. These included the selection of a worldwide Customer 
Relationship Management solution to manage the organization's export promotion 
activities and the deployment of a secure remote network access system.</P>
<P>In 2006, Ms. Burns joined the Department of the Interior (DOI) where she 
served as the Director of Information Planning in the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Indian Affairs OCIO. She was in charge of managing the 
organization's Enterprise Architecture, Capital Planning and Investment Control 
activities, information technology (IT) budget and acquisitions, as well as IT 
policy. She played a pivotal role in the Indian Affairs reconnection to the 
Internet in 2008 after the organization was required to disconnect by court 
order in 2001.

In August 2009, Ms. Burns officially assumed the position as the Division 
Chief for Portfolio Management within Interior's Departmental Office of the 
Chief Information Officer (OCIO). As the Division Chief, Ms. Burns was 
responsible for the management and oversight of the Department's approximately 
$1 billion information technology (IT) investment portfolio and Capital Planning 
and Investment Control (CPIC) activities. She was the team leader for the DOI 
Innovations and Efficiencies Team (DIET) that triggered a grassroots effort to 
improve the operational efficiency of the Department's highly fragmented IT 
infrastructure. This contributed significantly to the Department's decision to 
centralize all IT under the Department's CIO in December 2010.</P>
<P>In October 2010, Ms. Burns was certified by the Office of Personnel 
Management for appointment to the Senior Executive Service following her 
completion of Interior's Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program. 
In 2006, Ms. Burns graduated from the Council in Excellence in Government's eGov 
Fellowship program and has been a senior fellow since that time. Her experience 
includes private sector research and data analysis consulting, as well as work 
in international trade
