Joo Chung is the Director of Oversight and Compliance (DO&C) in the 
Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer, Office of the Secretary of 
Defense, at the Department of Defense. Ms. Chung oversees a Directorate 
comprised of three divisions: the Intelligence Oversight Division, the 
Regulatory, Audit, and Advisory Division, and the Defense Privacy, Civil 
Liberties, and Transparency Division. DO&C's primary mission is to ensure 
that the DoD complies with internal and external requirements and policies in 
DO&C's functional areas of responsibilities by providing guidance, training, 
and oversight of programs and activities; and to provide and develop meaningful 
and sound policies to promote identified principles consistent with the DoD's 
missions.

Ms. Chung's highly regarded and expert team is responsible for various DoD 
policies and programs including in the areas of privacy, civil liberties, 
Freedom of Information Act, regulations, and intelligence oversight. The impact 
of her Directorate's work is significant, as it affects all military members, 
retirees, and their dependents, as well as the DoD Components, the Defense 
Agencies, and the Combatant Commands. She is the Department's Senior Agency 
Official for Privacy, and her Deputy serves as the Department's Senior 
Intelligence Oversight Official.

From August 2012 to April 2015, Ms. Chung served as the Director of the 
Department of Justice's (DOJ) Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties (OPCL) and 
served as DOJ's Acting Chief Privacy and Civil Liberties Officer (CPCLO), a 
statutorily mandated position in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
(ODAG), between September 2012 and November 2013. As Director of OPCL, she had 
oversight and compliance responsibilities over DOJ's 40 plus components and has 
reviewed numerous legal and policy issues involving privacy, civil liberties, 
and transparency issues related to the Department's law enforcement and national 
security programs and activities. Additionally, she was the principal author and 
editor of DOJ's widely used biennial treatise on existing Privacy Act case law 
titled, "Overview of the Privacy Act of 1974."

Ms. Chung began her law career at DOJ in 2000 as an Attorney General Honors 
Program Attorney at the then Office of Information and Privacy, where she 
litigated and worked on both Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act 
matters.
