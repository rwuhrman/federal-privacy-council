Alexander W. Joel is the Chief of the Office of Civil Liberties, Privacy and 
Transparency (CLPT) for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence 
(ODNI). CLPT works to ensure that the Intelligence Community carries out its 
national security mission in a manner that protects privacy and civil liberties, 
and, at the same time, provides appropriate transparency to the public. As Chief 
of CLPT, Mr. Joel serves as the Civil Liberties Protection Officer, a position 
established by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act of 2004.

Reporting directly to the Director of National Intelligence, the Civil 
Liberties Protection Officer’s responsibilities include ensuring that the 
protection of privacy and civil liberties is appropriately incorporated in 
Intelligence Community policies and procedures, reviewing complaints of possible 
abuses of privacy and civil liberties in programs and operations administered by 
the ODNI, and ensuring that the use of technology sustains, and does not erode, 
privacy. Mr. Joel's appointment to this position was announced by then-Director 
of National Intelligence John Negroponte in December 2005. Mr. Joel had 
previously been performing the duties of that position on an interim basis.

In addition, Mr. Joel serves as the ODNI’s Chief Transparency Officer. In 
that capacity, he chairs the Intelligence Transparency Council, and leads and 
coordinates the IC’s efforts to enhance transparency, consistent with the 
Principles of Intelligence Transparency for the Intelligence Community. Director 
of National Intelligence James Clapper named him to that position in October 
2015.
