### Federal Privacy Council meets with International Data Protection Authorities

On Monday, March 26, 2018, the Federal Privacy Council, in coordination with the Privacy Branch of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), hosted a meeting with international Data Protection Authorities.  Over 35 representatives from 16 countries joined Senior Agency Officials for Privacy on the Federal Privacy Council in the Indian Treaty Room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.  

The agenda included remarks from the OIRA Administrator, Neomi Rao, and presentations on the United Statesâ€™ privacy framework.  Kirsten Moncada, Chair of the Federal Privacy Council, provided a presentation on the U.S. privacy framework that focused on the roles and responsibilities of Senior Agency Officials for Privacy, OMB, and the Federal Privacy Council, followed by a presentation by Council members, Ben Huebner, CIA, Erin Prest, FBI, and Lauren Bernick, ODNI, on implementing privacy in the intelligence community.  The meeting then proceeded to open discussion amongst attendees that touched on models and approaches used in different countries to oversee privacy, and challenges faced by privacy and data protection professionals across the board.
